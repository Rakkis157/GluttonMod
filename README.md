# GluttonMod
GluttonMod is a mod for the game **Slay the Spire** that introduces a new character, The Glutton. It is currently a work in progress, and the individual card balance and artwork are certain to change.

The Glutton Mod will feature 75 new cards and 11 new relics (currently 60 and 8 respectively as of 0.6). The Glutton resolves around self inflicted harm, whether in the form of self damage, inflicting debuffs on himself, filling his own deck with painful status cards, or even spending gold in combat for powerful effects.

The Glutton begins with the Relic **Eternal Hunger** which lets him draw an additional card each turn at the cost of one HP (though this Relic will never deal the last point of damage to you).

# Dependencies
BaseMod, ModTheSpire, and STSLib are all required to run GluttonMod

# Credits
I would like to thank the developers of Slay the Spire for making such an amazing game, as well as the mod community for their support and providing such helpful modding resources.
